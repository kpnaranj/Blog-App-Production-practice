Check:
1. For beginners: for learning purposes
2. Setup guide

1. For beginners (Do it yourself): 
This template is taken from: https://developerhandbook.com/react/getting-started-nextjs/ (without babel)Credits to developer: Jon Preece. Thanks. 

1. Set up next create app (using yarn) you can change to npm 

yarn create next-app 
--it will ask your project name

2. Install express 
-- To run express and next tgether the json file needs to contain the two dependencies

--disadvantage: All dependencies are in one json file (backend and frontend)

use: yarn add express 

3. create a folder called server (optional name)

4. create index.js and set up express (use code from server/index.js as reference)

5. Change dev :"next dev" for "node server/index.js" (it reference our server with calls our app)

6. run using yarn dev (or any other setting)

--With nodemon settings 

1. Add nodemon: yarn add --dev nodemon
2. Create a nodemon.json file (add settings code)
--understand nodemon 
    a. watch = check the file server for changes 
    b. exec = execute node server/index.js
    c. ext = find any extension with js
3. Update the packages.json (add nodemon in dev)
4. nodemon will connect to the json file 

--With babel settings  
1. Add the following dependency 
@babel/node to run babel-node 
2. Create a babelrc (add babel configuration)
--Understanding babelrc
    a. Presets: next/babel replaces the 
    configuration of @babel/env and @babel/core to the environment of next 
    b. Plugings: Uses the babel-preset -stage-0 to add javascript features
Note: More details of how it works can be found here: https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/customizing-babel-config
